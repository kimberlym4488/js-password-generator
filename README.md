## Project Description
This project creates a password generator for a user at a company who utilizes various applications with varying password requirements. My goal was to give the user options to make the password as complex or basic as they need it to be depending on the requirements.

# Features
I've added in user input options that show up as alerts/prompts to the user. 
> * They have to choose a length between 8 and 128 characters. 
> * There is an option to have special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and/or numbers.
    > * If the user chooses none of these options, the process will return them to the start. 

## Summary
By using JavaScript we can create a randomized system to pull characters from various arrays. If they don't enter minimum requirements they will be prompted to start over. This will give the user flexibility while maintaining the goals of the password length and options.
