## Project Description
This project creates a password generator for a user at a company who utilizes various applications with varying password requirements. My goal was to give the user options to make the password as complex or basic as they need it to be depending on the requirements.

# Features
This generator contains user prompts that will require input from the user in order to proceed:

&#10004; Choose a length between 8 and 128 characters.

&#10004; Choose if the password will contain special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and/or numbers.

    If the user chooses a length outside the options specified or doesn't choose any categories (special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, or numbers), the system will return them to the start. 

## Summary
By using JavaScript code we can create a prompt system to acquire choices from the user. Then we apply these choices to specific arrays and require at least one of each chosen array value be included in the final password. The rest of the password is decided at random from the remaining character selection pool (made up of the user choices). This will give the user flexibility and randomization while maintaining the goals of the password length and available options.
